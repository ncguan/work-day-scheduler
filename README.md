## Summary

This project was built to create a schedule with a daily planner. The planner has the current date displayed under the heading. Time blocks from 9AM to 5PM is presented in the planner. Time blocks are color coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green). Events can be entered in the time blocks and saved into the local storage so that the saved events presist even after refreshing the page.

## Usage

Enter an event in the time block by clicking onto the time block and typing out the event. Save an event into local storage by clicking the blue button next to the event time block that you want to save.
